# Drone-audio-detection-project

Objective: Train a model that detects drone sounds from background sounds.

Detecting drones using audio signals is of utmost significance for enhancing safety in modern society. As drones continue to proliferate, the ability to identify and locate them through audio detection methods is crucial. Audio-based drone detection technology serves as an essential tool in safeguarding public spaces, critical infrastructure, and events, preventing security breaches, and ensuring airspace integrity. By leveraging sound analysis, it allows for the early detection and response to drones, thus mitigating potential safety risks and privacy concerns associated with their operation.This project offers an opportunity to explore audio data processing, model development, and real-world applications in audio classification.
